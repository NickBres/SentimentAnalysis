# Sentiment Analysis of Social Mediaâ€™s Messages

This project aims to classify posts from social media platforms (specifically Twitter and Reddit) into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. Utilizing deep learning models and sentiment analysis techniques, this project analyzes vast amounts of social media data to understand public opinion, customer satisfaction, and more.

## Project Overview

Sentiment analysis has become a crucial tool in leveraging the data generated on social media platforms. Our project specifically focuses on analyzing the sentiments of messages using advanced natural language processing techniques. With a dataset comprising approximately 200,000 Twitter and Reddit posts, we've developed models to accurately classify these sentiments.
